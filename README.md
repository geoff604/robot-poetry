Robot Poetry 0.0.1
by Geoff Peters

Nov. 3, 2008

A hosted version of this app is available to use at:
http://www.gpeters.com/auto/autotype.php

and more info is at:
http://www.robotpoetry.com

Note: 
to host this application yourself, you'll need a Google SOAP API key.
Unfortunately Google isn't giving out any more of these keys.
But this app could also be driven off of the Yahoo Web Search API 
or the MSN Search API, with some minor modifications to Goapi.php.

About

The Poetry Robot will help you write poems, suggesting words from Google. 
Type a few words to get started, and click submit. 

---------------------------------------
Where do the suggested words come from? 

The words are taken from other web pages which rank highly on the Google search engine.

-----------------
How does it work? 

This program uses the Google Search Engine to determine some of the most 
common words that might make sense to complete your sentence.

It looks at the last few words of what you typed to determine some words 
that should come next.

-------------------
Multiple Languages: 

You can try any language with Roman-based characters 
(such as French, German, Italian, Spanish, etc.) by typing words 
into the box. It can now handle accented characters.

-----------
Discussion: 

Do you find the system somewhat intelligent? 
Maybe it is a form of Artificial Intelligence, 
in a limited way? Let me know what you think.
